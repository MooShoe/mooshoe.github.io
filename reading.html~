        <p>hi im jacob and i like <a href="reading.html">reading</a>, <a href="#">dog walking<a>, and <a href="#">doing stuff with computers</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="index.html">home</a></li>
            <li><a href="contact.html">contact</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">blog</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">projects</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I guess recently I've come to enjoy reading. It gets my mind running. Taking other people's accumulation of all the idea's they've ever seen condensed into paper and combining them with my own abstract ideas helps me create my own accumulation of clear thoughts and ideas.<br><br>The whole idea of millions of some of our clearest thinking individuals with so many interesting experiences putting some of their best thinking right into my head for me to entertain is magical. Or dizzying. Not really sure.<br><br>Here is a list of all the books I've read since September 2nd, 2018 that I think are worth your time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#theoneworldschoolhouse"><em><strong>The One World Schoolhouse</strong></em> by Salman Khan</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="theoneworldschoolhouse">The One World Schoolhouse</a></h2>
        <p><strong>Intresting?</strong> <em>Sure, it's a pretty intresting viewpoint of education</em></p>
        <p><strong>Date Completed:</strong> September 2, 2018</p>
        <p>It was interesting to have someone who really benefited from our educational system in the US completely shit on it after meeting the other groups of people who don't benefit from it. Khan made a lot of good points on the flaws of our educational system and pointed out the frustrating aspect of how schools today are just using computers to use computers for the sake of it. (I think computers are almost as big of a deal as reading was 600 years ago and just as reading reinvented education I think computers should reinvent our system too)<br><br>Nevertheless, halfway through Khan runs out of things he wants to criticize so he starts daydreaming about a better, almost utopian school and then onto an almost utopian educational system which could never materialize because our whole society would need to foundationally change to make it work.</p>
