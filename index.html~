        <p>hello im Jacob and I'm only allowed to call myself a student but I like to think of myself as an explorer of the human condition because I have come to believe that the act of exploring and expressing ourselves is the most important part of being human. ;)<br><br>I feel like everyone has their "thing" - something that they're really good at, but more importantly is really special to them. Mine is computing. Some of my fondest memories are haphazardly copying and pasting digitalocean guides and the delight in myself for changing my GTK stylesheet for the first time. <a target="_blank" href="http://satya164.xyz/numix/">it was called numix</a> in case you were curious)<br><br>Before you go, one other thing I think you should know about me is that I like talking about computing as much actually doing computing myself so <a href="#">I guess I made something for that too.</a></p>
