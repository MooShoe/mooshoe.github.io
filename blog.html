        <p><strong>welcome to my little place where I develop my thoughts by putting them down on paper:</strong><br><br>So I guess this is my blog but I'm not calling this a blog because that's not what I want to it to be. When you create a blog, there's an expectation that it consistantly gets new pieces on the same subject, in a diary-like format. There won't be any specific format here or any specific topic. Or any consistancy for when I release a new piece. You may see me writing more about one thing or more consistantly for releasing some pieces, but that's not intentional... I guess it was just what I was thinking about at that time.<br><br>Another thing I want to do here is only put down things that I believe are actually intresting. I think this will ensure that what's here is going to be worth reading. There is no point in sharing anything that is not worth reading and thinking about - no one will remember that. And people don't write to make something that no one will remember. People write to share their ideas with others, the most important part of being human to me.<br><br>Here is a list of all of my pieces that I've written since September 8th, 2018:</p>
